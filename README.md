# cc

The least optimized compiler you'll ever see.

TODO:
- actually be able to program in this language
- add octal char, hex char, unicode code point escape codes in lexer
- add size attribute to symbol
- add power of two optimization for mul, div, mod
- support lvalues not just being identifiers
- add comma operator (have to make it lower precedence than =)
    - honestly almost never used
- make it so single semicolons are valid
- add good error messages
